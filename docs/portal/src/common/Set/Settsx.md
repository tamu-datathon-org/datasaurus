# Set

* js code for showing a group of cards
* Set displays 4 elements by default, show more button will be there if there's more than 4 cards in a set
    - if screen size is below 1200 px, it shows all elements at once
* You can filter a set based on events that are currently happening, start time, and alphabetical using the info prop (TODO make sure this is true)
