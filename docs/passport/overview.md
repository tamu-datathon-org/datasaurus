# Overview

Passport serves as a participant check-in system for events that occur during TAMU Datathon. Inside it, participant data (e.g. years attended and dining attended) is updated and stored in [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) when they attend an event during Datathon. 

Extrapolating data from previous events allows us to have a general idea of attendance for future events. In turn, this helps us plan and budget more effectively for future events (e.g., not overspending or underspending on a dining event).
