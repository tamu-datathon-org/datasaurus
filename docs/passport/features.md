# Features

This repository contains a page with a QR code scanner and buttons that are used by our volunteers to check participants into specific events. It also has the ability to add or remove users as volunteers.

However, its main functionality is to create a passport (or update an existing one) holding information about the years that they have attended and the events that they have attended, with an emphasis on dining events.
