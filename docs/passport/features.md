# Features

## QR Code Scanner
This repository contains a page with a QR code scanner and buttons that are used by our volunteers to check participants into specific events. It also has the ability to add or remove users as volunteers. This simply acts as a tool for us to access a specific user's information in our database.

## Update Database with User Information
Its primary functionality is to create a passport (or update an existing one) holding information about the years that they have attended and the events that they have attended, with an emphasis on dining events.
